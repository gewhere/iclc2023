* Things to consider
  - [ ] Package reproducibility
    + python:3.9-slim was selected because it is compatible with librosa
    + Should we provide a complete list of package versions? (both unix/docker and python)?
  - [ ] Can we build the docker image from the Anonymous Github?
    + I think, it is not possible because of the git-lfs dependency
    + Thus, the solution is to provide only the prebuilt image?
  - [ ] Can we use the Algorave10 flyer in the article? Attribution? (it looks nice:)
